Readme!

ForgetMeNotFlora is a simple webscraper tool for botanists to create PDF flashcards containing key taxonomic information.

Usage:
Enter list of plant names, as per plantnet naming conventions. e.g. Acacia floribunda, in the file plant.txt
Next, run 'Python3 main.py'
In your terminal, you will be asked to modify the data retrieved in each .txt file corresponding to each plant in the list.
This allows you to choose the most important information for the flashcard, and also to add your personal notes, fun facts and anecdotes to aid your memory.
The PDFs will populate the current folder.
